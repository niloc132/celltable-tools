/**
 * Simplifies creation of {@link com.google.gwt.user.cellview.client.Column} objects for a 
 * {@link CellTable}. Interfaces extending this may be declared and requested using GWT.create, and
 * used to add columns to the CellTable.
 * 
 * Declared methods should return a type which implements {@link com.google.gwt.cell.client.Cell},
 * and may be named for the properties available in the data to be drawn by the CellTable instance.
 * As with the {@link com.google.gwt.editor.client.Editor} framework and its implementors, these 
 * methods may be named as desired, with a {@link com.google.gwt.editor.client.Editor.Path}
 * annotation declaring how the data may be accessed. Again, as with Editor, the path provided may
 * be blank, indicating the row itself, or may reference nested properties.
 * 
 * Cell instances will be created through the use of GWT.create, allowing for replacement or 
 * generation. If you wish to provide your own implementation, either create the Column object
 * manually, or see {@link ColumnsWithFactory} for a way to provide a factory instance.
 * 
 * Once a Cell has been created, either by calling the declared methods directly, or by calling
 * configure(...), it will be retained, so that subsequent calls will get the same instance. At this
 * time there is no support for getting access to the Column instances.
 * 
 * Further extending a subinterface of Columns to add more columns is not supported at this time.
